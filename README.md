## 🕹️ Platformer Game

A simple 2D platformer written in C++ using raylib. Jump, collect fruits, and dodge enemies!

> Original solo project created using C++ and raylib. Applied what I learned from smaller guided games to build a complete game from scratch, including level logic, enemies, and UI.

## 🚀 Features

Tile-based levels loaded from .txt files

Moving enemies and collectibles

Player movement, jumping, and collision

Basic UI (score, lives, pause menu)

Game state handling (menu, playing, pause, game over, win screen)

## 🛠️ Requirements

C++ compiler

raylib installed

CMake (if you're using a build system like CLion)
